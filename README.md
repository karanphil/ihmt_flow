# ihMT pipeline
===================

Flow to process ihMT images. This flow generated four myelin indices maps from the inhomogeneous Magnetization Transfer (ihMT) images. 

Input Data recommendation:
  - it is recommended to use dcm2niix (v1.0.20200331) to convert data
    https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases/tag/v1.0.20200331
  - dcm2niix conversion will create all echo files for each contrast and
    corresponding json files
  - all input must have a matching json file with the same filename
  - all contrasts must have a same number of echoes and coregistered
    between them before running the script.
  - Mask must be coregistered to the echo images
  - ANTs can be used for the registration steps (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)
